# Tower of Hanoi
Algorithmic Thinking
* the stacking technique in Python
> [!NOTE]
>In Python, a stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. The two fundamental operations are:
* Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
* Pop: Removing the topmost element from the stack.
Using a List as a Stack
Python's built-in list can be used as a stack, where:
.append() is used to push elements.
.pop() is used to remove elements from the top.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Solver function [here](https://github.com/hainguyen1511/tower-of-Hanoi/blob/main/full%20tower%20hanoi.txt) will have repetitive steps that we could shrink down by recursive thinking
